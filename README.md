This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating an uncommon TypeError that can occur when an invalid input type is passed to a function. The solution shows how to handle such errors using exception handling. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` is designed to handle both `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError` exceptions.  The program demonstrates how to handle these uncommon scenarios in a robust way, improving code reliability.
